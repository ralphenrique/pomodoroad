**The PomodoRoad** is a creative **focus and productivity web application** that transforms goal-oriented work or study time into a simulated cross-country journey.

Instead of setting arbitrary timers, users plot a route between two real-world locations (e.g., Miami to Seattle). The actual, estimated driving duration for that route—the **Long Haul**—becomes the user’s overall focus goal.

The application leverages the **Pomodoro Technique** to structure the journey:

- Focus Sessions (The Drive):** Each 25-minute Pomodoro is visualized as a segment of the trip, with a car marker steadily progressing along the route line.

- Breaks (Rest Stops):** Short breaks are framed as necessary rest stops, allowing the user to refresh before getting back on the road.

The app's primary function is to **gamify sustained effort** by tying the abstract concept of time spent focusing to the tangible progress of covering distance, making long-term tasks feel manageable and rewarding until the final destination is reached.
